# BGFX Native Libraries
# These are large binary files that may be added to Git LFS in the future
# For now, they are ignored to keep the repository small during development

# macOS libraries
macos/arm64/*.dylib
macos/x86_64/*.dylib
macos/*/*.a
macos/*/*.so

# Windows libraries
windows/x64/*.dll
windows/x64/*.lib
